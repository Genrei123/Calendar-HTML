# Calendar-HTML
Calendar with background photos that is taken directly from Google Drive. Pretty fun activity for me!

//How to pull images directly from Googe drive?
1. Upload the image in Google drive.

2. Right click and click on share then update the permissions ''For anyone'' or Publicly.

3. Copy the link.
   Example link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kigpOePjFHezLjDoWtkH2-HMShEN0y42/view?usp=share_link
   
4. Follow this format. The file id is the combination of numbers and letters in the end of "d/" and the beginning of "/view"
   Format link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=<FILE ID>
   Formatted example link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kigpOePjFHezLjDoWtkH2-HMShEN0y42
   NOTE: To test if the link is working. You should paste the formatted link in the browser in which it should display the image.
